# MultipleLinearRegression
implementation of multiple linear regression framework through Python

In this program, it explores an aspect of machine learning called neaural network. Using a sample dataset that has n>1 amount of x-variables of real numbers and y-variable of real numbers, the program aims to predict the relationship between the x and y. The data was split into training data and testing data to do so: training set used to find optimal parameters of all the n theta values of the linear equation, testing set used to compare accuracy between actual output and predicted output. Instead of using the logistic regression class provided by Spyder, the mathematical process was thoroughly outlined hand by hand. This is reflected from the mathematics done in code of the data normalization, cost function, and gradient descent. To further understand the mathematics behind the multiple linear regression, refer to the "MultipleRegressionReport" file.

There were several dataset that was implemented and were called "Electricity" and "RealEstate". The accuracy of both datasets came out to be very similiar. By giving an iteration of 300,000 times, all parameters almost perfectly optimized. This was reflected by the amazing accuracy of exactly 99.2% for both training and test data as seen in the image attached.
